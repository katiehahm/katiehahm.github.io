                <p>
                  This project was for ENGR14: Solid Mechanics. Each group of 4 were were given the same materials: bolsa wood, glue, etc. to build our own bridge that would be both light and strong. We had freedom to choose our own designs.

                <p>
                  This is our completed bridge. It is about 30cm in length. We performed truss analysis on each joint, making sure that all members will not fail due to buckling, compression, or tension.

                <p>
                  To test our bridge, we applied weight onto the bridge until it broke. We compared this experimental maximum weight to the calculated/predicted max weight, and performed failure analysis. One example of why our bridge broke towards the side is because the weight was not distributed evenly throughout the bridge.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                  This was another project for ENGR14: Solid Mechanics. We were given the freedom to choose any subject, and any question, as long as we used the knowledge learned in the class. My partner and I decided to analyze whether firing an archery bow without an arrow will cause enough shock on the bow to break its limbs.

                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>
                  We asked this question because it is an important safety rule in archery: to never fire without a bow. We would perform field experiments and perform calculations to calculate the bending moment of the limbs, and compare that to the threshold. On the right is the free body diagram we used for our analysis. EXPLAIN WHY IT MAY BREAK SOMEWHERE

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  We concluded that there will be no breaking of the limbs due to the energy of the bow because the wood is flexible enough. However, we stated that fatiguing the wood may ultimately result in failure.
