## Katie's personal page
<!-- #### July 14, 2014

## Overview

#### Motivation

The page should be a personal page mostly to share/track my photos for fun, but also for potential employers to look at my resume.

#### Content

Home page: welcome + background photo
About page: short description of me + contact information (email, github)
Resume page: my resume for potential employers
Timeline page: to track my photos in a timeline (probably a vertical line)

## Design

There will be navigation tabs to go to the four pages. The design will be simple and easy to read.

## Code

<nav> for navigating the tabs
lots of photos in the background/sides
resume will need many header types and font
